# 1st Challenge Mockup

General motivation is to make this web site more accesible and put in an order the HTML and CSS elements in this project. 

This project taught to improve new skills of organizing the web page, which made more accesible for the users.

As a solution, used sementic elements, HTML elements were put in a correct structure and position, extra typed elements were discarded and fallen in sequential order. Unnecessary multi group codes combined in a section.git

As a beginner of web developer, I learned what the semantic elements are and how they are used on the website.
